www.darkmere.gen.nz Website
===========================

[Hugo](http://gohugo.io) based version of this website. Currently using the [Hyde-y](https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-y/) theme

This replaces the shell-scipt based version I originally created in 1999(!). 

I've not created any new pages here since 2007 but there are a few pages I wanted to keep:

* Linux.conf.au first timers guide
* Where are ihug Engineering guys now?
* Bladestroller Quotes
* Domestic Blindness Information Page 

The Bladestroller and Domestic Blindness pages are unlikely to change but 
if you have updates for the other two pages please email me or submit a pull
request. Both of those pages are in markdown format in the /content directory.

Todo:
* I'm also planning to setup this site to deploy via travis
* Update logo
* Go though old site and copy any additional pages or photos
* Add more links
* Update the front page some more with info on what is here.
