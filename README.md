www.darkmere.gen.nz Website
===========================

[Hugo](http://gohugo.io) based version of this website. Currently using the [Hyde-y](https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-y/) theme

This to replace the shell-scipt based version I originally created in 1999(!). 

I've not created any new pages here since 2007 but there are a few pages I want to keep:

* Linux.conf.au first timers guide
* Where are ihug Engineering guys now?
* Bladestroller Quotes
* Domestic Blindness Information Page 

and maybe a couple of others.

Most likely with nicer URLs.

I'm also planning to setup this site to deploy via travis
