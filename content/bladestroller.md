In [late 2002](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=ah1m2i%24575%40web.eng.baileynm.com&output=gplain) [Peter da Silva](http://www.taronga.com/~peter/) changed his Usenet signature to a parody of Blade Runner called Bladestroller:

    I've seen things you people can't imagine. Chimneysweeps on fire over the roofs
    of London. I've watched kite-strings glitter in the sun at Hyde Park Gate.  All
    these things will be lost in time, like chalk-paintings in the rain.   '-_-'  
    Time for your nap.  | Peter da Silva | Har du kramat din varg, idag?    'U`

or with the signature bits removed:

> I've seen things you people can't imagine. 
> Chimneysweeps on fire over the roofs of London.
> I've watched kite-strings glitter in the sun at Hyde Park Gate.
> All these things will be lost in time, like chalk-paintings in the rain. 
> Time for your nap.
 
The original quote from the iconic movie [Blade Runner](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0083658") is:

> I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.
> Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. 
> I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. 
> All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
> Time to die.
 
There is also a longer version by Peter (I assume) that doesn't appear to be
archived anywhere as follows:

> I caught <i>Bladestroller</i> on the Schrodinger channel last night.
> 
> The climactic sequence, where the android Mary chases Dick van Dyke across the rooftops, tumbling chimneys to the pavement below, decapitating chimneysweeps with one stroke of her furled umbrella, is probably the best special effects sequence of the pre-computer era.
> The last few minutes, when Dick van Dyke tumbles from St Pauls and Mary saves him, catching him by the collar of his natty boating jacket with the parrot-headed handle of her dread weapon, then falls back against the dome of the cathedral... I was literally shaking.
> The contrast between the firm but kind nanny and the hellish alter-ego exposed as her dying cybernetic brain breaks down is amazing. Simply amazing.
> The only thing that comes close is possibly Steve Martin's portrayal of Lili Tomlin's character in <i>All of Me</i> and its many sequels.
> 
> I've seen things you people can't imagine.<br> 
> Chimneysweeps on fire over the roofs of London.<br>
> I've watched kite-strings glitter in the sun at Hyde Park Gate.<br>
> All these things will be lost in time, like chalk-paintings in the rain.<br>
> Time for my nap.<br>
>			-- Julie Andrews, Bladestroller
